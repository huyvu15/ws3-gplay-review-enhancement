##### Introduction
DistilBERT-SST2 is a DistilBERT model fine-tuned on the SST-2 dataset for binary sentiment analysis (positive/negative) at the sentence level. The model is compact, fast inference, with good accuracy for common sentiment analysis tasks.

##### Concepts
- DistilBERT is a distilled version of BERT through knowledge distillation technique: fewer parameters (~40% less), faster inference (up to ~60% faster) while retaining most of BERT's performance.
- SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank v2) assigns binary sentiment labels to sentences; the model output is probability/label of Positive or Negative.
- Results are typically obtained using Softmax over two classes; thresholds can be adjusted for different business objectives.

##### Text Classification into Positive/Negative

The reason for using this model is that the collected data has a content column containing user reviews.

##### Quick Implementation

**Hugging Face Transformers:**
```python
from transformers import pipeline
classifier = pipeline("sentiment-analysis", model="distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english")
print(classifier("This product is awesome!"))
```

Output: ```{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.999}```

Easy deployment in Flask/FastAPI to create APIs for real-time serving.

##### Real-world Applications
- Sentiment analysis of app reviews, customer feedback, social media posts.
- Early warning and prioritization of negative feedback processing in support workflows.
- Monitoring sentiment trends over time for brand/product reporting.
- Preprocessing step for advanced pipelines: topic classification, ticket routing, summarization.
