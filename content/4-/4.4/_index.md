â‡’ Do the same for the trigger lambda job processing from the sentiment model

With EventBridge, we have successfully set up periodic schedules for both app_details and app_reviews, and can similarly extend to other jobs like sentiment analysis. This scheduling helps the system:

- Automate the data crawling process without manual intervention.

- Ensure continuous updates with the latest data, maintaining accuracy and timeliness.

- Easily scale to many other tasks in the data pipeline.

Thanks to this, the entire data processing flow becomes proactive, stable, and capable of long-term operation. This is one of the important steps to build a more automated and intelligent data analysis system.
